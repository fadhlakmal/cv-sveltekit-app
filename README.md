# TensorFlow.js in SvelteKit

This web application showcases the integration of TensorFlow.js, a powerful JavaScript library for machine learning and deep learning, within the SvelteKit framework. With TensorFlow.js, I've implemented two machine learning features at the moment: **Image Classification** and **Real-Time Object Detection**.

- **Image Classification:** This application uses a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify images. It can recognize a wide range of objects and provide classification results with high accuracy.

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizing the COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model, our app can detect and locate objects within a live video stream from your webcam. It overlays bounding boxes on detected objects for a visually engaging experience.

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit:** This web application is built on top of the SvelteKit framework, which provides a fast and efficient development environment for building modern web applications.

- **TensorFlow.js:** Enable machine learning capabilities directly within your web browser using TensorFlow.js.

- **MobileNet:** The [MobileNet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/mobilenet) model is used for image classification. It's a versatile, lightweight model that excels at real-time tasks.

- **COCO-SSD:** For real-time object detection, I've integrated the [COCO-SSD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd) model. It can identify a wide range of objects within images and video streams.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies:
